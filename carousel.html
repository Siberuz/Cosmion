                with a diameter of about 86,881 miles (139,822 kilometers). It
                is known for its vibrant bands of clouds, including the iconic
                Great Red Spot, a massive storm that has been raging for
                centuries. Jupiter has a strong magnetic field and more than 75
                known moons, with the four largest—Io, Europa, Ganymede, and
                Callisto—known as the Galilean moons. The planet's composition
                primarily consists of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter's immense
